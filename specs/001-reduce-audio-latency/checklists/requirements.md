# Specification Quality Checklist: Reduce Audio Streaming Latency

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026/04/12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`.
- SC-001 uses "at least 50% reduction from current baseline" — baseline is not precisely measured; plan phase should include a measurement step before implementation.
- FR-007 (adaptive buffering) corresponds to User Story 3 (P3) and is intentionally marked SHOULD rather than MUST to keep it decoupled from the core P1 deliverable.
